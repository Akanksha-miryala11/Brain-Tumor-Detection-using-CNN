# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-CNN
Brain tumor detection using CNN involves training a convolutional neural network to analyze MRI images and classify them as tumor or non-tumor. The CNN automatically extracts features, improving accuracy and efficiency in early diagnosis, aiding doctors in faster, more reliable detection and treatment planning.
